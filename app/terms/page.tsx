          4. Third Party Materials
        </h2>
        <div className="mb-2 ml-8">
          <p>
            <strong>4.1.</strong> The Service may require, enable or facilitate
            access to or use of software or services of a third party
            (&quot;Third Party&quot;). In such an event, there may be terms of
            use relating to the use of Third Party software or service (the
            &quot;Third Party Terms&quot;). The Third Party Terms shall be
            deemed to include any privacy policies and acceptable use policies
            as are applicable to you. We may be required under or as a result of
            the Third Party Terms to notify you of certain terms that apply to
            you (either directly as an end user, or as a party whose acts or
            omissions could cause us to breach the Third Party Terms) when you
            use the Services. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source
            software terms or standard form terms of the distribution platform
            from which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play
            Store or Apple App Store terms) which bind us as a developer or user
            of the distribution platform (the &quot;Distribution Terms&quot;).
            Information on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service,
            already accounted for in these Terms of Use, publicly available
            (e.g. the Distribution Terms) or otherwise indicated in the Schedule
            herein. For the avoidance of doubt, insofar as this Clause 4 relates
            to the Distribution Terms, the relevant Distribution Terms are the
            terms of the specific distribution platform from which you obtained
            a copy of the software or application that is part of the Service.
            For example, if you obtained the said copy from the Google Play
            Store, then the relevant terms are Google&apos;s Distribution Terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>4.2.</strong> It is your responsibility to check and read
            the most up-to-date versions of these Third Party Terms and you are
            deemed to have notice of the same. It is your responsibility to
            comply with the Third Party Terms. In particular, you are deemed to
            have notice of the Third Party Terms that we (under the Third Party
            Terms) are required to notify you, and you unconditionally agree to
            be bound by all the obligations in the Third Party Terms which are
            applicable to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>4.3.</strong> If the Third Party Terms require you to enter
            into an agreement directly with the Third Party, it is your
            responsibility to enter into such agreement with the Third Party.
            For the avoidance of doubt:
          </p>

          <div className="mb-2 ml-16">
            <p>
              <strong>4.3.1.</strong> some Third Party Terms (particularly
              open-source terms) permit either a direct licence to you from the
              Third Party or a sublicence from us to you. In such cases, your
              licence is deemed to be a direct licence from the Third Party to
              you; and
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>4.3.2.</strong> the terms of your agreement with the Third
              Party will govern your use of the relevant third party software or
              service, and not these Terms of Use.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            <strong>4.4.</strong> If the Third Party Terms expressly or
            impliedly require us to incorporate certain terms in these Terms of
            Use (inclusive of terms which impose any minimum or maximum
            standards herein, and terms described in Clause 4.5 below), such
            terms are deemed to have been so incorporated (the
            &quot;Incorporated Terms&quot;). Examples of Incorporated Terms
            include provisions which require us to give you notice of certain
            rights and liabilities or require us to ensure that you acknowledge
            certain matters. Similarly, if the Third Party Terms expressly or
            impliedly require these Terms of Use to be altered such that the
            Third Party Terms are complied with, the parties herein agree that
            the Terms of Use shall be deemed to be so altered but only to the
            extent necessary for compliance.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>4.5.</strong> Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party,
            or require us to grant the Third Party, direct rights of enforcement
            of these Terms of Use as a third party beneficiary, against you.
            Such Third Party Terms are deemed to have been incorporated into
            these Terms of Use as Incorporated Terms, and you hereby agree to
            grant such Third Party, such direct rights of enforcement against
            you.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>4.6.</strong> For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice
            to Clause 4.4, in relation to the access or use of software or
            services of a Third Party, to the extent of any inconsistency
            between these Terms of Use and the Third Party Terms, the latter
            shall prevail provided nothing in the Third Party Terms increases
            the liability of us beyond that stated in Clause 6.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>4.7.</strong> Without prejudice and in addition to the
            foregoing, we shall not be responsible for your use of any software
            or service of a Third Party.
